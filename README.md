# employee-trackerdb

## Description
This is a employee tracker database built from scratch. This app uses the comman line interface to generate a database to display and organize employee data. The user is a business owner who wants to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their companyso, so they can organize and plan their business. Node inquire runs, however, I think I have a firewall or something blocking mysql server. I have tried to kill a second mysql server running as well as restart my system.
